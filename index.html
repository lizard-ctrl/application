  <p id="yourGift">🕊 Dear <span class="userName"></span> 🕊,</p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    I hope this is finding you softly and sweetly. To start I am a web developer, designer, and artist. Currently I am a digital producer at the Phillips art auction house and a contract designer with Coco Marketing working for a few clients including the Brooklyn Museum. I am non-binary, a former SW, and living in Philadelphia, PA. 
<br><br>
    Creating experimental websites is my preferred way to communicate conceptual ideas and research. CSS intimately fits in with my personal practices. CSS invokes the artist in me, it feels as if I am drawing, painting, and sculpting with properties, classes, and tags. I was introduced to web development through a design and technology program which has informed the way I code greatly. I am always thinking through a lens of poetic computation. When I made my first website with just HTML and CSS it felt like magic. CSS breathes life into the bones of HTML and transforms it. I use CSS statically, like a zine maker, collaging and manipulating placements, and fluidly to create web animations and movement. I use CSS IDs and Classes to create hidden digital poems of my own. CSS can turn a website from static and neutral to a website blooming and full. I believe the internet is the most interesting when you’re stumbling on someone's handmade page. 
    <br><br>
    CSS is the seed of all my websites. Recently I have been working on a series of websites as greeting cards. These are single serving pages meant to be used in place of a physical card, drawing on net art aesthetics and inspired by greeting gifs, which seem nostalgic and new all at once. Using some simple CSS brings movement into these websites, as seen with the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/digi-garden/">Thank You Card</a> and the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/mirror/">I Love You Card.</a>  Another project of mine, <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/thesisonefinal/">Our Body Online,</a> uses light CSS with JS to create impactful design and movement. The purpose is to illustrate the thin veil between our bodies, others bodies, and the body of the internet. In <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/havewemet/">R/Havewemet</a> I utilized CSS to create a map of the imaginary town in the aforementioned subreddit. Specific locations are attributed to each home along with CSS tooltips. When you click into the process page I am able to use CSS to visually cue to the user that the narrative of the site is now shifting. I see CSS as a key tool in my worldbuilding online. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of web development I also create sculptures, write, and make films. I feel that all of my practices feed off of eachother. My sculpture work normally involves physical computation, my most recent project being a <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/can-art-make-us-lol-these-nyc-comedians-want-to-find-out-092123">“Yassified Billy Bass”</a> that sings and dances at your touch.  My writing practice is currently focused towards <a href="https://my-boyfriend.com/">My Boyfriend Lit Mag</a> where I write pieces that analyze and poke at chronic onlineness while also doing the web and print design. My film work explores how we can build characters and narratives through screen recordings and performance on the computer as best shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl5jJr2k_xk">Ilovguys5675</a>. Everything I make has a running thread of poetic computation involved and has a multidisciplinary range.  
    <br><br>
    I have experience in collective and collaborative work as a facilitator, organizer, and participant. The best discoveries I’ve had artistically have come from being surrounded by people with different life experiences to create together. Most recently I participated in OOOhackathon where I collaborated with a group of eight people to create a set of vibrators that were activated by human biometrics. Working intimately with this group over a short period of time was so fulfilling and led to us all learning from each other on a topic we were mutually passionate about. I have also participated in NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program camp which is a month-long skill sharing event. I was able to facilitate workshops and collectively guide people in my cohort to discover new parts of their practice. In past years I have organized feminist wikipedia edit-a-thons and have found so much joy in working towards a collective purpose. Being involved with collaborative work always leaves me feeling invigorated, whether I am leading or participating. Knowledge should always be shared among others; there is nothing more beautiful to me than open source. I believe collective learning and collective creation is the only way forward. 
    <br><br>
    A presentation I would like to propose would be a web performance of an expanded version of the WIP <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/core-studio-fall/daily-sketches/sketch2/index.html">All Of My Data.</a> This project presents my full digital footprint. This includes public digital posts of mine but also data collected from applications and images stored in the cloud. CSS helps me to orchestrate the user’s movements on the website while also helping to build design and structure. The newer version has been in progress for a bit and I would be proud to share it. I would like to walk through the website and the rehearsed movements while also touching on security and safety online.
    <br><br>
    I am so grateful for the opportunity to submit an application with you and am looking forward to hearing back.
    <br><br>

CSS can turn a website from static and neutral to a website blooming and full. I believe the internet is the most interesting when you’re stumbling on someone's handmade page. 
    <br><br>
    CSS is the seed of all my websites. Recently I have been working on a series of websites as greeting cards. These are single serving pages meant to be used in place of a physical card, drawing on net art aesthetics and inspired by greeting gifs, which seem nostalgic and new all at once. Using some simple CSS brings movement into these websites, as seen with the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/digi-garden/">Thank You Card</a> and the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/mirror/">I Love You Card.</a>  Another project of mine, <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/thesisonefinal/">Our Body Online,</a> uses light CSS with JS to create impactful design and movement. The purpose is to illustrate the thin veil between our bodies, others bodies, and the body of the internet. In <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/havewemet/">R/Havewemet</a> I utilized CSS to create a map of the imaginary town in the aforementioned subreddit. Specific locations are attributed to each home along with CSS tooltips. When you click into the process page I am able to use CSS to visually cue to the user that the narrative of the site is now shifting. I see CSS as a key tool in my worldbuilding online. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of web development I also create sculptures, write, and make films. I feel that all of my practices feed off of eachother. My sculpture work normally involves physical computation, my most recent project being a <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/can-art-make-us-lol-these-nyc-comedians-want-to-find-out-092123">“Yassified Billy Bass”</a> that sings and dances at your touch.  My writing practice is currently focused towards <a href="https://my-boyfriend.com/">My Boyfriend Lit Mag</a> where I write pieces that analyze and poke at chronic onlineness while also doing the web and print design. My film work explores how we can build characters and narratives through screen recordings and performance on the computer as best shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl5jJr2k_xk">Ilovguys5675</a>. Everything I make has a running thread of poetic computation involved and has a multidisciplinary range.  
    <br><br>
    I have experience in collective and collaborative work as a facilitator, organizer, and participant. The best discoveries I’ve had artistically have come from being surrounded by people with different life experiences to create together. Most recently I participated in OOOhackathon where I collaborated with a group of eight people to create a set of vibrators that were activated by human biometrics. Working intimately with this group over a short period of time was so fulfilling and led to us all learning from each other on a topic we were mutually passionate about. I have also participated in NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program camp which is a month-long skill sharing event. I was able to facilitate workshops and collectively guide people in my cohort to discover new parts of their practice. In past years I have organized feminist wikipedia edit-a-thons and have found so much joy in working towards a collective purpose. Being involved with collaborative work always leaves me feeling invigorated, whether I am leading or participating. Knowledge should always be shared among others; there is nothing more beautiful to me than open source. I believe collective learning and collective creation is the only way forward. 
    <br><br>
    A presentation I would like to propose would be a web performance of an expanded version of the WIP <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/core-studio-fall/daily-sketches/sketch2/index.html">All Of My Data.</a> This project presents my full digital footprint. This includes public digital posts of mine but also data collected from applications and images stored in the cloud. CSS helps me to orchestrate the user’s movements on the website while also helping to build design and structure. The newer version has been in progress for a bit and I would be proud to share it. I would like to walk through the website and the rehearsed movements while also touching on security and safety online.
    <br><br>
    I am so grateful for the opportunity to submit an application with you and am looking forward to hearing back.

<p id="yourGift">🕊 Dear <span class="userName"></span> 🕊,</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  I hope this is finding you softly and sweetly. To start I am a web developer, designer, and artist. Currently I am a digital producer at the Phillips art auction house and a contract designer with Coco Marketing working for a few clients including the Brooklyn Museum. I am non-binary, a former SW, and living in Philadelphia, PA. 
<br><br>
  Creating experimental websites is my preferred way to communicate conceptual ideas and research. CSS intimately fits in with my personal practices. CSS invokes the artist in me, it feels as if I am drawing, painting, and sculpting with properties, classes, and tags. I was introduced to web development through a design and technology program which has informed the way I code greatly. I am always thinking through a lens of poetic computation. When I made my first website with just HTML and CSS it felt like magic. CSS breathes life into the bones of HTML and transforms it. I use CSS statically, like a zine maker, collaging and manipulating placements, and fluidly to create web animations and movement. I use CSS IDs and Classes to create hidden digital poems of my own. CSS can turn a website from static and neutral to a website blooming and full. I believe the internet is the most interesting when you’re stumbling on someone's handmade page. 
  <br><br>
  CSS is the seed of all my websites. Recently I have been working on a series of websites as greeting cards. These are single serving pages meant to be used in place of a physical card, drawing on net art aesthetics and inspired by greeting gifs, which seem nostalgic and new all at once. Using some simple CSS brings movement into these websites, as seen with the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/digi-garden/">Thank You Card</a> and the <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/mirror/">I Love You Card.</a>  Another project of mine, <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/thesisonefinal/">Our Body Online,</a> uses light CSS with JS to create impactful design and movement. The purpose is to illustrate the thin veil between our bodies, others bodies, and the body of the internet. In <a href="https://lizard-ctrl.github.io/havewemet/">R/Havewemet</a> I utilized CSS to create a map of the imaginary town in the aforementioned subreddit. Specific locations are attributed to each home along with CSS tooltips.

My writing practice is currently focused towards <a href="https://my-boyfriend.com/">My Boyfriend Lit Mag</a> where I write pieces that analyze and poke at chronic onlineness while also doing the web and print design.
